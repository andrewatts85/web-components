# Web Components

Web Components are a concept used in modern web development to break a web application into small, more-easily manageable parts. Essentially, this is a small, visual template you create with the intention of re-using it. You will learn more about the deeper philosophy behind web components in the future. For this project, you will create your first web component that you can re-use from here onward.
